## Phylogenetic tree used in models

This folder contains the data needed to reconstruct and view the phylogenetic tree used in these analyses. The data was run through IQ-TREE. The command run is in the file ITS_correct.log. It requires the alignment (merged_alignmentsmatKrbcLITS_250419_corrected.phy), the constraint tree as a backbone (constraint_tree3.newick) and the partition file (UK_ITS_matK_rbcL_concat_partitionfile250419).

The whole tree is in the file ITS_correct.treefile.
